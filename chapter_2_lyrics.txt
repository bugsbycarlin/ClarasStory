In the morning she went in to the town
Everybody used a car to get around

And the street was full of wheels on the ground
Everybody made an irritating honking sound

Clara said to herself I won't get very far
Unless I take a bus a taxi or a car

Even if it means I’m sitting in the traffic
So I’ll make myself a ride with just a little magic

(Choreography notes: 
    there should be 8 staccato “honk” onomatopoeia on ir-i-ta-tin hon-king sou-nd)
    on “Clara said to herself”, we should cut away to clara imaginging herself
    bus, taxi, or a car should put clara’s imagined self into these vehicles one by one, each replacing the last, center screen
    add cars all through “even if it means i’m sitting in the traffic”
    subtract them through the next line, and finish by adding the four vehicle options in a square
)

(Interactive: choose a vehicle for Clara. Car, Truck, Bus, or Taxi)
(Interactive: make the vehicle)
(Interactive: choose a color!)

So she got into the <car|bus|taxi|truck> and set off   (behind the wheel)
But the traffic quickly came to a stop

Clara got out and she climbed to a treetop
And from up there she could see there was an awful gridlock

Several cars ahead were driving on the wrong side
Clara said I think I’ll have to ditch my new ride

Back to walking on the sidewalk but I’d like
to go faster so I think I’ll make myself a new bike

(Interactive: make a bike)
(Interactive: choose a color!)

Clara rode her bike around the city blocks
Ventured in and out of different kinds of shops

And she asked all of the people she was meeting
If they’d trade her for a spacious house with central heating

Everybody only laughed at the question
Til she happened on a mural painting session

When the painter of the mural heard her speak
He said maybe I can help you find the thing that you seek

Do you see my dapper style? I am the paint beast.
I believe you’ve met my brother and his fruit feast.

We don’t have a house to give you for your troubles
But I’ve got a boat I’ll give it to you on the double

I need help to paint this mural for my young niece
For her restaurant (we’re calling it The Pie Peace)

And my niece could use your help to make her food
So if you help us then surely we will also help you

(Interactive: color paints to finish the mural)
(Pink, Blue, Red, Green, and maybe Black, Grey, Orange, Purple)

Clara used her magic wand to help the paint beast
And the mural turned out well and he was most pleased

So he took her in to meet his restaurant niece
She said nice to meet you gal, I am the Food beast

Are you ready to make food with your magic
And a couple handy dandy kitchen gadgets?

Then let’s go back to the kitchen to make food
Or just take a break! Because is the end of chapter 2.
